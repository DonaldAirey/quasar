	/// Manages the gaps found in the row versions between the server and client.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>As the server processes transactions, the row version is changed for any of the effected records.  The client uses
	/// these version numbers to reconcile the local data model with the servers.  If the client detects that is it missing some
	/// records, it will ask the server for those records during the next reconciliation cycle.  However, the sequence of row
	/// versions is not monotonically increasing like they would be for a message based system like FIX.  A client may miss some of
	/// the changes because it was shut down or because multiple updates to a record occurred during a single transaction.  To keep
	/// the list of unfillable gaps from increasing without bounds, this gap processor will keep track of the gaps and purge them 
	/// after a programmable time.  If this time is greater than the maximum time allowed for a transaction, then the client is
	/// guaranteed to stay in sync with the server.</remarks>
